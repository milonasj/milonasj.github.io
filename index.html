    	<p style="text-align:justify;">Thank you for taking the time to learn more about the December 11 referendum to maintain and strengthen educational excellence at Red Bank Regional.  This site will provide details about the project and how it will benefit our students and community.

            <h3 class="text-muted">The referendum’s two questions are designed to target five vital areas</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="row"><br>
        <p><b>Question #1</b></p>
<p><b>Meet Growing Enrollment Needs</b>: Current enrollment already exceeds building capacity and a recent demographic student predicts further significant increases.  To put it simply, RBR is starting to burst at the seams.</p>

<p><b>Ensure continuation of tuition revenue</b>: Dwindling classroom space will further reduce our ability to accept tuition paying out-of-district students, a large source of revenue for our district.  RBR taxpayers are now paying over $1.2 million more per year than we were just 4 years ago due to lost tuition revenue.</p>

<p><b>Improve our facilities for academic programs</b>: Our remarkable students, staff, and programs are housed in a facility that is nearly 50 years old.  No major change in the footprint has occurred since it was opened in 1975.  Modern learning spaces will inspire students and support programs aligned with 21st century needs.</p>

<p><b>Necessary Maintenance of Physical Plant</b>: The roof is approaching the end of its service life. It’s replacement is approximately $6.1 million.  A project this large cannot be paid for within the regular budget.</p>
<p><b>Question #2</b> </p>
<p><b>Addresses items identified in the strategic plan developed by our community and adopted in 2016.</b>  Included are the installation on an artificial turf field and a new concession stand with restrooms.</p>

      	  	<p>RBR is a unique school in many ways. Since 1984 RBR has accepted out-of-district students that pay tuition either by their sending school districts or their parents. The tuition revenue we receive has covered the cost to educate these students as well the cost of <i>all</i> of our award-winning academy programs, <i>all</i> of our athletic programs, and <i>all</i> of our extra-curricular activities <i>and</i> more. Due to increased enrollment from the core districts we have reduced the number tuition students, which has increased the burden placed on district taxpayers. As previously stated, our tax- payers are now paying over $1.2M more per year than we were just 4 years ago due to lost tuition revenue.</p>
 
<p>If the referendum fails, RBR will still need a new roof, will still need additional classroom space, and will not have a mechanism to fund the needed work. If the referendum fails, we may be faced with a difficult situation where our taxes will most likely still go up, and we may have still have to cut programs.</p>
